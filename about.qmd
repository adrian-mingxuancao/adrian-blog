# About This Blog

Welcome to my genomics blog! I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of computational biology, machine learning, and genomics research.

## Focus Areas

This blog covers several key areas in modern genomics:

- **Computational Genomics**: Analysis and interpretation of genomic data using computational methods
- **Machine Learning in Biology**: Applications of ML and AI in genomic prediction and modeling
- **Regulatory Genomics**: Understanding how regulatory elements control gene expression
- **Evolutionary Genomics**: Studying genomic evolution and its implications
- **Clinical Genomics**: Translating genomic insights into clinical applications

## Blog Structure

Posts are organized in the `blog-posts/` directory, with each post focusing on synthesizing insights from recent research papers. The goal is to provide both technical depth and accessible explanations of complex genomic concepts.

## Contact
